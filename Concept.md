I. 🔬 Theoretical Foundation: Live Visual Branding Control
This interface is designed as a real-time visual control center for VJs managing event branding assets — DJ logos, sponsor visuals, ambient cycles, and scheduled transitions — with high clarity, minimal friction, and adaptability to live performance pressure.

🔄 Dual-State System Theory
The visual display operates in two layers:

Cycle Layer

A looping set of logos or visuals, always running by default

Used for ambient venue branding (e.g., house logos, sponsors)

Behaves like a slideshow or clip launcher

Schedule Layer

Time-locked events that override the cycle

Used for DJ introductions, sponsor callouts, special visual cues

Behaves like a timeline or playlist with priority

III. 🧠 Interface Concepts & Philosophy
✅ Goals:
At-a-glance clarity: Always know what’s playing, what’s next

Live manipulation: Drag, drop, edit, and trigger on the fly

Tag-based intelligence: Smart links between DJs, logos, and visuals

Minimal distractions: UX fades into the background when not needed

Progressive disclosure: More power revealed only when you want it
